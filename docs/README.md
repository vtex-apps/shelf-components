## Usage

This app uses our store builder with the blocks architecture. To know more about Store Builder [click here.](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/understanding-storebuilder-and-stylesbuilder#structuring-and-configuring-our-store-with-object-object)

To use this app, you need to import in your dependencies on `manifest.json`.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.shelf-components": "0.x"
  }
```

### Styles API

This app provides some CSS classes as an API for style customization.

To use this CSS API, you must add the `styles` builder and create an app styling CSS file.

1. Add the `styles` builder to your `manifest.json`:

```json
  "builders": {
    "styles": "1.x"
  }
```

2. Create a file called `vtex.shelf-components.css` inside the `styles/css` folder. Add your custom styles:

```css
.container {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```
